# Bottlenecks and Solutions

## Identified Bottlenecks

### 1. ML Model Inference Latency
**Problem**: TensorFlow Serving GPU inference takes 30-50ms
**Impact**: Blocks 95th percentile latency target of <100ms
**Solutions**:
- Model quantization (INT8) for 3x speedup
- Batch inference for throughput optimization  
- Model distillation to smaller architecture
- Edge caching of popular predictions

### 2. Feature Store Latency
**Problem**: Redis feature lookups take 10-20ms for cold data
**Impact**: Adds significant latency to recommendation pipeline
**Solutions**:
- Multi-level caching (L1: local, L2: Redis, L3: PostgreSQL)
- Pre-computation of user/place feature vectors
- Feature streaming from Kafka for hot updates
- Geographic sharding of feature data

### 3. Geospatial Query Performance  
**Problem**: PostGIS radius queries slow for large datasets
**Impact**: 20-40ms for nearby place lookups
**Solutions**:
- Redis Geospatial for hot geographic data
- Spatial indexing optimization (R-tree, Quad-tree)
- Pre-computed geographic grids
- Elasticsearch geospatial queries

### 4. Database Connection Pool Exhaustion
**Problem**: PostgreSQL connection limits under high load
**Impact**: Connection timeouts during traffic spikes
**Solutions**:
- Connection pooling (PgBouncer)
- Read replica scaling
- Database sharding by geography
- Async query patterns

### 5. Memory Usage in Feature Processing
**Problem**: Large feature matrices consume excessive RAM
**Impact**: Out-of-memory errors during peak load
**Solutions**:
- Sparse feature representations
- Feature selection and dimensionality reduction
- Streaming feature processing
- Memory-mapped feature storage

## Mitigation Strategies

### Horizontal Scaling
```yaml
Auto-scaling Policies:
  recommendation_service:
    min_replicas: 10
    max_replicas: 100
    cpu_threshold: 70%
    memory_threshold: 80%
    
  feature_store:
    min_replicas: 6
    max_replicas: 18
    connection_threshold: 80%
    memory_threshold: 85%
```

### Vertical Scaling Limits
- **API Services**: Max 16 cores, 32GB RAM per instance
- **ML Inference**: GPU memory limits (80GB A100)
- **Database**: Max 128 cores, 4TB RAM per instance
- **Feature Store**: Max memory-optimized instances

### Geographic Distribution
```
Region           | Traffic % | Infrastructure
US-West         | 25%       | 40% of total capacity
US-East         | 15%       | 25% of total capacity  
EU-Central      | 30%       | 30% of total capacity
Asia-Pacific    | 20%       | 25% of total capacity
Other           | 10%       | 10% of total capacity (CDN)
```

### Circuit Breaker Patterns
- **Database**: 5 failures in 10s → 30s breaker
- **Feature Store**: 10 failures in 10s → 15s breaker  
- **ML Models**: 3 failures in 10s → 60s breaker
- **External APIs**: 5 failures in 30s → 120s breaker
