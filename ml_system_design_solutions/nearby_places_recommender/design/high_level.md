## Core Components

### 1. API Gateway
- **Purpose**: Request routing, authentication, rate limiting
- **Technology**: Kong, AWS API Gateway
- **Features**: SSL termination, request/response transformation

### 2. Recommendation Service
- **Purpose**: Main ML recommendation engine
- **Components**:
  - Candidate Generation: Find nearby places using geospatial queries
  - Ranking Model: Score and rank candidates using ML model
  - Post-processing: Apply business rules, diversity, freshness
- **Technology**: Python/FastAPI, TensorFlow Serving

### 3. Feature Store
- **Purpose**: Centralized feature management and serving
- **Features**:
  - User features: preferences, history, demographics
  - Place features: category, ratings, price, popularity
  - Context features: time, weather, events, location
- **Technology**: Feast, Redis for real-time features

### 4. ML Pipeline
- **Purpose**: Model training and feature engineering
- **Components**:
  - Data ingestion from user interactions
  - Feature engineering and validation
  - Model training (collaborative filtering + content-based)
  - Model evaluation and deployment
- **Technology**: Apache Airflow, Spark, MLflow

### 5. Supporting Services

#### Place Service
- **Database**: Place metadata, business hours, categories
- **Geospatial Index**: Efficient location-based queries
- **Technology**: PostgreSQL with PostGIS, Elasticsearch

#### User Service
- **Database**: User profiles, preferences, interaction history
- **Technology**: PostgreSQL, Redis for session data

#### Location Service
- **Purpose**: Real-time location tracking and geofencing
- **Technology**: Redis Geospatial, Apache Kafka for events

## Data Flow

1. **User Request**: Mobile app sends location + user context
2. **Candidate Generation**: Find places within radius using geospatial query
3. **Feature Enrichment**: Fetch user, place, and context features
4. **ML Ranking**: Score candidates using trained model
5. **Post-processing**: Apply business rules, ensure diversity
6. **Response**: Return ranked list of recommendations
7. **Feedback Loop**: Log user interactions for model retraining
